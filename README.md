2D-pixel-game-project1
This is the project that i was doing with my classmates during semester at college.

In this project, I was helping our main programmer with the code and I was also accountable for music. The only music that did not make by myself was the attackSWORD.mp3, healSound.mp3 and the music when the character dies(Hans Zimmer - Day One).
